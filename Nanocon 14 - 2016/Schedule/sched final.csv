64,Social Deception,Y,11/11/2016 2:30 PM,11/11/2016 7:00 PM,Conglomerate of Social Deception games,,,"Social Deception games are games whose primary focus is lying and detecting liars. Games such as: Coup, Secret Hitler, One Night Ultimate Werewolf, and The Resistance are all short games that you can spend 15-30 minutes playing. Another game that might (provided enough players want to play it and have the time to play) be played is Battlestar Galactica(120-240 minutes play time). <br /> <br /> Coup (2-6 players): There are 5 different influence cards and each one has 3 copies of it in the deck.The game starts with each player having 2 influence cards and two coins. Each type of influence card has different actions it can provide during your[the player] turn. During other players turn you have counteractions that you influence cards give you. This is where the social deception is. Players can and will bluff! One card is the Duke, each turn the duke can take something called duke tax which grants him 3 coins as opposed to 1. Many players will start play claiming to be a duke such as if there are 5 players each one claims to be a Duke you know there is only 3 dukes, odds are a few players are bluffing you can try to call them out or just let it play.<br /> <br /> Secret Hitler (5-10 players): The political agenda has been swayed, fascist are now attempting to seize control of the political regime, and put Hitler into power. There are two factions, liberals and fascists, each has their own objectives in order to win. The liberals are trying to pass 5 liberal policies or kill Hitler. Fascists are trying to pass 6 fascists policies or get Hitler into the chancellor office after the 3 fascist policy has been played. At the start of the game players find out what side they are on and then all players close their eyes and then Hitler gives a signal (raises his thumb) while keeping his eyes closed as the fascists open their eyes identify the other fascists and identify who Hitler is. There are multiple ways of play but this is generally how the game is played. More rules regarding play are in the instructions.<br /> <br /> One Night Ultimate Werewolf (3-10 players): The villagers have uncovered a frightening truth there are werewolves nearby. There are a lot mechanics in this game so much so that I can't pick out what to say for it. Essentially, the villagers have to work out who the werewolf is or are out of their group and agree (via vote) to kill said player(s). Be careful though since there may be no werewolves.<br /> <br /> The Resistance (5-10 players): Revolution can be difficult to pull off, especially when spies have infiltrated your ranks. You[the players] are attempting to overthrow an Empire and free your allies through the successful completion of various missions set out by teams of players. However, complications can arise when others are acting against this agenda from within your own ranks.<br /> <br /> Battlestar Galactica (3-6 players): This game is similar to how the actual series was in the remake from 2004. Players are in a desperate race to get to Kobol before the spy can implement major parts of their plan.<br /> <br />",,Paul Manley,,,,,Gaming Table 6,,,,,,,,,,n
