11,Cthulhu: Gloom,Y,7/11/15 12:00,7/11/15 14:00,Card Game,"Card Game, Cthulhu",,"A transparent card game from Atlas Games<br /> <br /> From Dunwich to Innsmouth, from the halls of Miskatonic University to the Charles Dexter Ward at Arkham Sanitarium, trouble is in the air. The stars are almost right, and terrors from beyond space and time are beginning to break through. When Cthulhu rises, we're all doomed -- but whose downfall will be the most entertaining?<br /> <br /> In Cthulhu Gloom, you control a group of Lovecraftian protagonists and guide them down a path of horror and madness to an untimely death, while keeping your opponents happy, healthy, and annoyingly alive. While your characters Gibber With Ghouls and Learn Loathsome Lore to earn negative points, you'll encourage your opponents to be Analyzed by Alienists and to Just Forget About the Fungus to pile on positive points. When one group finally falls prey to the interdimensional doom that awaits us all, the player whose characters have suffered the most wins.<br /> <br /> Cthulhu Gloom is printed on transparent plastic cards. Multiple Modifier cards can be played on top of the same Character card; since the cards are transparent, elements from previously played Modifier cards either show through or are obscured by those played above them. You can immediately and easily see the point value of every character, no matter how many Modifiers they have piled on.<br /> <br /> Cthulhu Gloom is a stand-alone card game that's also fully compatible with Gloom and its expansions. It introduces Story cards and Transformation cards.<br /> <br /> One or more Story cards can be placed face up on the table at the start of the game; the first player to meet the conditions of a card -- drawing the attention of The King in Yellow or heeding The Call of Cthulhu, for example -- can claim it and gain the benefits it lists.<br /> <br /> Transformation cards have ongoing effects that remain with a character throughout his life, along with a picture that replaces the character's original art with something hideous and slimy; when you've Felt Rather Fishy or been Minced by Mi-Go, the squamous results aren't easily forgotten!<br />",,Chad Keifer,,,,,Gaming Table 3,,,,,,,,,,
12,Archer: the Danger Zone! Board game,Y,7/11/15 14:30,7/11/15 15:30,Board Game,"Archer, Board Game",,"Archer The Danger Zone! Board Game: A high-stakes game of espionage, international intrigue, and screwing over your co-workers.<br /> <br /> The object of the game is to gain the Upper Hand over your opponents by insulting them, doing well on missions (quite the ego boost), and encountering random guest stars and secondary characters from the show. Each player starts with 5 Upper Hand. The first player to get to 20 Upper Hand wins the game.<br /> <br /> Each player chooses one of the following characters to play: Archer, Lana, Malory, Cyril, Pam, Cheryl, Ray or Dr. Krieger. The insults and dirty tricks you deliver to the other players are based on actual quotes from the show that your character makes. The cards in your unique deck of 20 cards give you the ability to hurl insults, &acirc;&euro;&oelig;come on&acirc;&euro;ù to another character, or say something that builds up your character&acirc;&euro;&trade;s own ego.<br /> <br /> The action takes place at the ISIS Headquarters, though spy missions send the gang off to exotic locales each round of play. The game features 6 important office locations within ISIS, but you (typically) play with around 4 of them, making each game play out very differently as the &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Office Map&acirc;&euro;ù will be vary from game to game. Each location does something different, but only the first person to go to each location each round gets the benefit listed on that location. Surely there will be no name calling when another player beats you to the punch!<br /> <br /> The game is all about other players ticking you off and wanting to get the better of them.<br /> <br /> There are naturally plenty of opportunities to belittle your co-workers while in the office and out in the field. Doing so will knock them down a peg or two on the Upper Hand track.<br /> <br /> It all adds up to a humorously good time!",,Chad Keifer,,,,,Gaming Table 2,,,,,,,,,,
13,Gloom!,Y,7/11/15 16:00,7/11/15 18:00,Card Game,"Card Game, Gloom",,"<br /> The world of Gloom is a sad and benighted place. The sky is gray, the tea is cold, and a new tragedy lies around every corner. Debt, disease, heartache, and packs of rabid flesh-eating mice -- just when it seems like things can't get any worse, they do. But some say that one's reward in the afterlife is based on the misery endured in life. If so, there may yet be hope -- if not in this world, then in the peace that lies beyond.<br /> <br /> In the Gloom card game, you assume control of the fate of an eccentric family of misfits and misanthropes. The goal of the game is sad, but simple: you want your characters to suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death. You'll play horrible mishaps like Pursued by Poodles or Mocked by Midgets on your own characters to lower their Self-Worth scores, while trying to cheer your opponents' characters with marriages and other happy occasions that pile on positive points. The player with the lowest total Family Value wins.<br /> <br /> Printed on transparent plastic cards, Gloom features an innovative design by noted RPG author Keith Baker. Multiple modifier cards can be played on top of the same character card; since the cards are transparent, elements from previously played modifier cards either show through or are obscured by those played above them. You'll immediately and easily know the worth of every character, no matter how many modifiers they have. You've got to see (through) this game to believe it!<br />",,Chad Keifer,,,,,Gaming Table 3,,,,,,,,,,

Amongst the ruins of the Choral City and Siren Hold, the benighted caverns of Calth or the volcanic crags of Istvaan V small bands of Astartes hunted each other down mercilessly. This is war- fare distilled down into its most bitter form, where death is a guarantee and the only thing driving day to day existence is to deliver vengeance upon your foes.<br /> <br /> Scrounge an extra clip for your bolter, check your armor seals and gather the few remaining loyal brothers to your side as you prepare to do battle on a personal scale! Before the event play- ers will be split into Survivors and Exterminators. Throughout the day VPs will be tallied and one side will be declared the victor.<br /> <br /> During this event you will play 3 games on battlefields cluttered with ruins or close corridor environs. Gameplay will be more focused on movement and outmaneuvering your opponent before driving home the killing blow. All the while you&acirc;&euro;&trade;ll need to gather supply points to upkeep your weaponry and armor between games.<br /> <br /> This is a Horus Heresy specific variant utilizing the Tactical Strike rules. As such, it requires the use of the Forge World Horus Heresy Books. In particular pages 166-177 of Book 3. Players will need to be quite familiar with this variant ruleset.<br /> <br /> What makes Tactical Strike unique is that models are pur- chased on an individual basis, allowing you to create a force of mixed legions armed with an eclectic array of weaponry. Each participant will have 3 army lists prepared at 200, 250 and 300 point levels. In addition players may choose up to 3 characters from a separate pool of 150 points. This force will be generated from Horus Heresy Books 1-4.<br /> <br /> Play aids will be made available to speed up and clarify play.
