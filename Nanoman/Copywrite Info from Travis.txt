Here are the three sizes for use on posters and digital media. I did add the promo image with a flashier background for use on social media. If you require any other sizes or formats let me know.

My only terms for the use of this new Nanoman is that no alternation be made to him (color, pose, additions) with my express permission and that credit for this iteration of Nanoman be given to me on social media or websites that use these images with links to my design website www.travisbentley.com.

I thank you for the chance to let me re-envision the Nanocon mascot in my own style.
