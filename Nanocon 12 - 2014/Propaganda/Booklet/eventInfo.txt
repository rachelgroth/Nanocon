<b>Pathfinder Society Scenario #5-21: The Merchant's Wake</b>
Gaming Table 3	7:00 pm-12:00 am
<i>Jason Rosauer</i>
A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 1-5.<br /> <br /> A powerful Qadiran trade prince has died, and faction leader Aaqir al'Hakam rushes to his homeland to attend his mentor's funeral. As an act of support, the Pathfinder Society sends the PCs as representatives to the event; however the death of such an influential merchant and politician has created a considerable power vacuum, and ambitious acquaintances from across the Inner Sea are in attendance to pay their respects, claim a piece of the trade prince's legacy, and undercut their rivals' attempts to do the same. Can the Pathfinders keep this somber event from spiraling into a bloodbath?<br /> <br /> Content in "The Merchant's Wake" also contributes directly to the ongoing storyline of the Qadira faction.

A Pathfinder Society Scenario designed for levels 5-9.<br /> <br /> Few are as adept at fighting demons as the Riftwardens, an organization of spellcasters dedicated to protecting the boundaries between the planes. Many are already committed to the Fifth Crusade in Mendev and are unable to assist the Pathfinders directly in the society's upcoming expedition into the Worldwound, but if the Pathfinders assist the Riftwardens elsewhere, perhaps a small number of the mages might be free to return the favor. Unfortunately, this means entering the godless nation Rahadoum, where several Riftwardens have recently disappeared.<br /> <br /> Content in "Port Godless" also contributes directly to the ongoing storylines of the Cheliax, Osirion, and Qadira factions.

<b>All Night Twilight Imperium</b>
Gaming Table 1	10:00 pm-6:00 am
<i>Lewis Bundy</i>
Twilight Imperium plus the first expansion: Shattered Empires. We will be playing all night. Please be prepared for this before you sit down. If you don't know the rules, we are willing to teach. 4-8 Players. 8+hrs Game time.<br /> <br /> An age of twilight shall once more spread across the galaxy. A broken empire shall once more be re-forged. Hidden powers from dark space shall come forth to make an ancient claim. War shall rage across space. Secret treaties, political whispers, and devious plots shall again echo through the halls of the imperial city on Mecatol Rex. TI3 is an epic empire-building game of interstellar conflict, trade, and struggle for power. Players take the roles of ancient galactic civilizations, each seeking to seize the imperial throne via warfare, diplomacy, and technological progression. With new oversize geomorphic board tiles, finely detailed plastic miniatures, hundreds of cards, and a massive plurality of options, TI3 will ship in a massive, epic-size box, with more than 200 masterfully sculpted oversize plastic miniatures - the typical TI units (Ground Forces, Cruisers, Dreadnaughts, Carriers, Fighters, PDS, and Space Docks) as well as two new units (the massive War Sun, and the Destroyer). TI3 contains new oversize board tiles, more than 400 cards, every known civilization of the Twilight Imperium universe, almost every expansion rule and component ever published for TI, a gorgeous graphical overhaul, and an impressive full color rules set. The TI gameplay has been refined and redone by original designer Christian T. Petersen. The new design features faster gameplay, and involves players in a far more active game experience with much less down-time. In addition, TI3 will include the new Race Cards, as well a dramatic new approach to the structure of the gameplay itself using the new Command system. Are you ready for another age of Twilight?<br /> <br /> At the end of empire, faint wind rustled through Salai's robes. It was calm, warm evening, and the bruised purple outline of the setting sun was still visible on the horizon. An evening made for calm contemplation and peace. Verus came to his emperor's side for the last time. Together, the two stood in the trembling tower, silently witnessing bloom of fires grow in their city like garden of destruction. The next wave of bombardments destroyed the imperial palace and everyone therein. The Lazax empire has fallen first into decay, and then, after long twilight, into history. It is done and gone, but new day is dawning, and your people have new chance to mold the Twilight Imperium to the design of your race. Twilight Imperium: Shattered Empire is an expansion for Twilight Imperium Third Edition. It enhances gameplay with variety of new options and enables you to play with seven or eight players in an epic struggle for true galactic dominance! Twilight Imperium: Shattered Empire includes: Four never-before-seen races join the struggle for empire!Two new colors of plastic units to allow for up to eight players in single game.Dozens of new system tiles, including new special systems such as Ion Storms, Hope's End, trade stations, and the Wormhole Nexus.Brand new technologies for all eight players, including new never-before-seen type of tech!Eight new variant strategy cards for completely different gameplay experience, and an additional variant Imperial strategy card for optional use with the core strategy set.An even broader array of agendas and options in the form of new Action, Political, and Objective cardsFacilities, shock troops, artifacts, space mines, and more!

The adventure map uses the same layout as the 2009 edition of Paizo's GameMastery Flip-Mat: Dungeon.

It can be used on its own or combined with its sequels, Masks of the Living God and City of Golden Death to create an even greater campaign arc.<br /> <br /> Designed specifically for the new Pathfinder Roleplaying Game rules and designed by the new game's primary designer, Crypt of the Everflame spotlights exciting new rules updates and character abilities, making the ideal introductory adventure for Pathfinder RPG players.

<b>Musical and Non-Musical Actions in the Rhythm Heaven Games</b>
Auditorium	11:00 am-12:00 pm
<i>Peter Shultz</i>
Basic idea is that these games present their own argument about the difference between musical actions and nonmusical ones. They take ostensibly nonmusical activities like hitting golf balls or spinning in an office chair and recast them as music by 1) putting them in a social situation that values cooperation, and 2) embedding them in a metric hierarchy. (Well, and also by adding overtly musical accompaniment.) They don't change the action itself, or its direct consequences: you still push A to hit the golf ball, but they add a layer of difficulty by exploiting the player's tacit sense of musical meter. So the games say that all actions can be performed in musical ways, and that when we treat things as music we make them easier in some ways, but harder in others.

<b>Getting Medieval on Nanocon: What the Middle Ages Can Teach Us About Integrated Design in Games</b>
Auditorium	1:00 pm-2:00 pm
<i>David Boffa</i>
For most medieval viewers art was found in the church, and they experienced it via a host of factors beyond an object&rsquo;s outward appearance. This included not just an artifact&rsquo;s original setting and related objects&mdash;e.g., a crucifixion above a church alter&mdash;but also the ritual performances that such objects and sites took part in. Recitations, gestures, songs, smells, sleights of hand&mdash;all contributed to an environment intended to elicit specific emotional or intellectual responses, such as the experience of Holy scripture or the divine presence. The tactics employed by medieval artisans, craftsmen, and performers to evoke these profound reactions offer useful paradigms for game developers. In particular, concepts of absence and presence, access and restriction, and sound and silence&mdash;all typical concepts for the Medieval art viewer or maker&mdash;can provide new means of conceptualizing the overall experience of a game.

Each playable character has their own abilities and weaknesses, and must all work together in order for humanity to have any hope of survival.

Players must attempt to expose the traitor while fuel shortages, food contaminations, and political unrest threatens to tear the fleet apart.<br /> <br /> 3 - 6 Players

<b>Camp Wicakini 5: The Funnel</b>
Gaming Table 6	9:30 pm-1:30 am
<i>Kevin Rohan, Silver Gryphon Games</i>
For almost 20 years, Wanagi Mato has been locked in a deep research facility owned by the Kinzey Corporation. He has had enough of the tests and the facility and he has decided to break out. It is up to you and your fellow heavy security team members to keep that from happening, lest the unthinkable happen and the zombie apocalypse starts in Wellstone City.<br /> <br /> This take on Savage Worlds puts each player in control of up to five security team members (with numbers declining rapidly!) to try to keep Wanagi Mato in the building. <br /> <br /> There's just one catch. There is only one Wild Card in the adventure, and it isn't any of the players...

With a few well-placed calls and a letter from the Black Dragons, even the PCs catch wind of his location; a hardened hotel used for witness protection in extreme cases. The Black Dragons want him out alive, while everyone else has a price on his head so big that it's scaring the small fish away, but the big time hitters are all drooling at the chance to hit Jerry and cash in big-time. On top of that, even the FBI guarding Jerry are salivating at the price-tag around his neck, and some of them have agreed to work together to take the little rat out themselves...<br /> <br /> Characters will be created at the table!

<b>Pathfinder Society Scenario #5-02 The Wardstone Patrol</b>
Gaming Table 1	9:00 am-2:00 pm
<i>Jason Rosauer</i>
A Pathfinder Society Scenario for characters of 3rd to 7th level (Tier 3-7).<br /> <br /> All-out war has erupted on the long-contested border between the crusader nation of Mendev and the demon-infested Worldwound. With the magical defenses that once held the demons at bay failing, defense of the region now falls to small patrols of mobile soldiers to resupply, reinforce, and communicate between the border's many fortresses and outposts. With so much at stake, the Pathfinder Society has enlisted many of its agents to assist in the war effort, both to protect its own interests and to prevent the onrushing tide of demonic attackers from plunging the entire Inner Sea region into chaos. On one such wardstone patrol, however, the party may find itself facing an enemy of an entirely different nature.
