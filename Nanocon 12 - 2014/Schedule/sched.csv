A misdialed phone call from one of the major players in Wellstone City hands an opportunity to you and your crew. It's just a simple job, the promise of a reward, but it's a start and it's a chance; in Wellstone, that's as good as cash in hand....

*A Nanocon Favorite!!!*

Bert, Ernie, Grover, Animal, Oscar, and Beeker have found themselves teaming up to hit an army wagon bound for Mexico during the Civil War. It is carrying a fortune of $1000 in gold, and the perfect place to hit it is just outside of the sleepy border town of El Rey. The PCs find themselves converging on the small town when they find out it might not be so sleepy after all...

Last night, the watch light at Milecastle 42 went out. This milecastle, much like yours, is one of many stationed along the frontier, keeping the Empire safe from the masses of living dead beyond the wall.

Find out why the light went out. Secure the fort, provide back up until more forces arrive if necessary, but above all, stay alive and keep the Empire safe!

He has had enough of the tests and the facility and he has decided to break out.  It is up to you and your fellow heavy security team members to keep that from happening, lest the unthinkable happen and the zombie apocalypse starts in Wellstone City.

This take on Savage Worlds puts each player in control of up to five security team members (with numbers declining rapidly!) to try to keep Wanagi Mato in the building. 

There's just one catch.  There is only one Wild Card in the adventure, and it isn't any of the players...",0,"Kevin Rohan",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"Silver Gryphon Games",0

If it had been just punk kids screwing around, that would be one thing, but the report came in from the State Patrol's office, and it was a confused, scared report…almost nervous to be turning in a report on…zombies?

They dispatched an officer, but he turned back and wants immediate backup from the FBI. It just so happens that a special team is in Denver and you're a member of that team. It's a quick 6 hour trip to the camp from Denver, and you're briefed on what to expect. Zombies, man…what is the world coming to?

Five years after the horrible disaster that resulted in a total loss of Camp Wicakini, it's been rebuilt. New counselors, new buildings, new everything…except for one man.

The new caretaker, Max Mason, was one of the last campers to stay at Wicakini. He survived the initial zombie onslaught, and then the government came and rescued him. He has sworn that what happened on that fateful day almost exactly 5 years ago would never happen again, and this time, he's prepared.

Unfortunately, the blight of Camp Wicakini, Wanagi Mato, is also prepared, and has been plotting revenge for 5 years…

None of this makes sense, but the pay is good, and the chance to work with the Kinzey's more in the future is way worth it.

Or so you thought. You have never been so wrong in all your life.

Have you ever had one of those days…one where nothing seems to be going right? One that starts out bad and just seems to get worse and worse? Today is one of those days. To top it off, your crew just got a call from the Boss; you have three hours to plan a bank hit, get something out of Vault Security Box 42, and get out. So far, you’ve broken a shoe lace, broken a mirror, and feel like you’re being stalked by black cats. You’ve got a bad, bad feeling about this…

Jerry “The Rat” Pauluzi has crossed sold out, and almost every major crime syndicate in town either wants him dead or has pulled their protection from him. With a few well-placed calls and a letter from the Black Dragons, even the PCs catch wind of his location; a hardened hotel used for witness protection in extreme cases. The Black Dragons want him out alive, while everyone else has a price on his head so big that it’s scaring the small fish away, but the big time hitters are all drooling at the chance to hit Jerry and cash in big-time. On top of that, even the FBI guarding Jerry are salivating at the price-tag around his neck, and some of them have agreed to work together to take the little rat out themselves…

You are a part of Bureau 8, a secret branch of the FBI that investigates the cases that the FBI can't. Last night, one of the Bureau's contacts, a mortician, called into the field office saying he has something that needs to be seen. After arriving, you see what he means; he has a guy on the slab with a double arm transplant and a pocket full of clues. You are to investigate what's going on, solve the problem, come back safe, but above all, keep it quiet!
