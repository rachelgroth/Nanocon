They dispatched an officer, but he turned back and wants immediate backup from the FBI. It just so happens that a special team is in Denver and you're a member of that team.

The new caretaker, Max Mason, was one of the last campers to stay at Wicakini. He survived the initial zombie onslaught, and then the government came and rescued him. He has sworn that what happened on that fateful day almost exactly 5 years ago would never happen again, and this time, he's prepared.

Unfortunately, the blight of Camp Wicakini, Wanagi Mato, is also prepared, and has been plotting revenge for 5 years…

An age of twilight shall once more spread across the galaxy. A broken empire shall once more be re-forged. Hidden powers from dark space shall come forth to make an ancient claim. War shall rage across space. Secret treaties, political whispers, and devious plots shall again echo through the halls of the imperial city on Mecatol Rex. TI3 is an epic empire-building game of interstellar conflict, trade, and struggle for power. Players take the roles of ancient galactic civilizations, each seeking to seize the imperial throne via warfare, diplomacy, and technological progression. With new oversize geomorphic board tiles, finely detailed plastic miniatures, hundreds of cards, and a massive plurality of options, TI3 will ship in a massive, epic-size box, with more than 200 masterfully sculpted oversize plastic miniatures - the typical TI units (Ground Forces, Cruisers, Dreadnaughts, Carriers, Fighters, PDS, and Space Docks) as well as two new units (the massive War Sun, and the Destroyer). TI3 contains new oversize board tiles, more than 400 cards, every known civilization of the Twilight Imperium universe, almost every expansion rule and component ever published for TI, a gorgeous graphical overhaul, and an impressive full color rules set. The TI gameplay has been refined and redone by original designer Christian T. Petersen. The new design features faster gameplay, and involves players in a far more active game experience with much less down-time. In addition, TI3 will include the new Race Cards, as well a dramatic new approach to the structure of the gameplay itself using the new Command system. Are you ready for another age of Twilight?

At the end of empire, faint wind rustled through Salai's robes. It was calm, warm evening, and the bruised purple outline of the setting sun was still visible on the horizon. An evening made for calm contemplation and peace. Verus came to his emperor's side for the last time. Together, the two stood in the trembling tower, silently witnessing bloom of fires grow in their city like garden of destruction. The next wave of bombardments destroyed the imperial palace and everyone therein. The Lazax empire has fallen first into decay, and then, after long twilight, into history. It is done and gone, but new day is dawning, and your people have new chance to mold the Twilight Imperium to the design of your race.
